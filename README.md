This guide aims to allow students at school to use Google Gemini (or Bard).

## Adding another account
### Step 1
To get started, you need to have an extra Google account.

1. Go to Settings (on your chromebook) and go to Accounts.
2. Then, click on your name and "Add Google Account"
3. Login as normal and you have successfully added the Google account!

> [!NOTE]  
> Some schools may or may not allow you to add new Google accounts. In that case, you're screwed.

## Accessing Gemini

### Step 2
1. First, type in the URL for Gemini.

2. Press Enter

3. You should see your school's login (if they have one)

If you don's have a login screen and you just see a "Restricted" screen, move on to Step 3. IF you are automatically allowed to use Gemini, then congrats!

### Step 3
1. Go type in the URL again (https://gemini.google.com)
2. At the end of the URL, add `/u/1`. This will allow you to login to Gemini using that Google account you added earlier.
3. Profit.
